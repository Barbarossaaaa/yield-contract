About this fork : 

This repository is a modified fork of the original project: 
Created and maintained by Barbarossaaaa

This version exists to:
* Try out fresh ideas and improvements 
* Run tests safely without touching the main repo 
* Explore, learn, and have fun experimenting 
⚠️ This isn’t an official release — it’s a personalized version made for my own testing and discovery.
